<h2> A  project made about a chatbot of the professional team FVRIA of CS2 </h2>

<p> The entire text and interaction system  with the user, along with the trail on the mouse pointer, was created using JavaScript. The HTML and CSS codes were used only to style the pages and give them a minimalist touch.</p>

<h2> All of the technologies that I used along the project üíæ</h2>
